# sqlite_encryped_for_js_php

Please copy exe + dll i.e. into the dir where the server have the html/php files. (for exeoutput %LocalAppData%\ExeOutput\{App GUID})
For php usage please look into jr_sqlite_secure.php

I'm using it as the JS frontend to encrypted sqlite in EXEOUTPUT https://www.exeoutput.com/
For JS usage - the php (jr_sqlite_secure.php) as a wraper is requested (as well as proper access right)

when installed try 
[sql ('select * from Cars')]
